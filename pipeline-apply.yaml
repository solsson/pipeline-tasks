# For cases where the CI environment doesn't own the pipeline

# Task used for repositories that need a tailored pipeline,
# i.e. version control (and branch) it with source
# Gets the pipeline.yaml from workspace + basedir
# Generates (or propagates) a pipeline run

# Set the actual git revision as param revision
# (see revision-ref-git.yaml sample task)

# TODO how would we handle branches of the pipeline,
# or actully how will pipeline history be tracked in Knative?
